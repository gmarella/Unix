Pipe:
    o We can think of pipe as a queue where we insert data from one end and read the data from the other end.
    o Pipe works as a queue in the sense we have a pair of file descriptors, one to write the data and the other one to read the
      data which is being written to other end using the other file descriptor.
    o Call to pipe returns us a pair of file descriptors. fds[2].
    o fds[0] is used to read the data.
    o fds[1] is used to write the data.

So, how eactly we can use pipes for the IPC.
    o We use pipe with the combination of fork().
    o When we call fork() from a running process, a clone of the current process is created which is called child process.
    o When a process is forked, all of its file descriptors are copied to the child process.
    o In this way, since both the parent and child have the file descriptors, we can use fd[0] in one process(reader) and
      fd[1] in the other process (writer).
